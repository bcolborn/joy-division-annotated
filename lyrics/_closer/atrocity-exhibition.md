# Atrocity Exhibition



The silence when doors open wide

Where people could pay to see inside

For entertainment they watch

his body twist

Behind his eyes he says I still exist

This is the way, step inside (4)



In arenas he kills for a prize

Wins a minute to add to his life

But the sickness is drowned

by cries for more

Pray to God make it quick - watch him fall

This is the way, step inside (4)



This is the way (4) This is the way,

step inside

You'll see the horrors of a far-away place

Meet the architects of law

face to face

See mass murder on a scale

you've never seen

And all the ones who tried hard

to succeed

This is the way, step inside (4)



And I picked on the whims of

a thousand more

Still pursuing the path

that's been buried

For years of dead woods and jungles and

cities on fire, can't replace

or relate,

can't release or repair -

take my hand,

and I'll show you what was - it will be.
