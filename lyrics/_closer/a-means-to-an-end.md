# A Means to an End

A legacy, so far removed

One day will be improved

Eternal rights beleft behind,

We were the better kind

You this day met free too,

I always looked to you (3)



We fought for good,

stood side by side

Our friendship never died

But stranger ways that froze on highs,

our vision touched the skies

Mortal list - the points to prove

I put my trust in you (3)



A house somewhere, on foreign soil

Where aching lovers called

Is this your goal, your final deeds

Where dogs and vultures eat?

Permitted still, I turned to go

I put my trust in you (4)

In you, in you, in you

Put my trust in you, in you
