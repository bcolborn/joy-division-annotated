title: Isolation
---
- Be clear every day, every evening
- It calls here aloud from above
- Carefully watched for a reason
- Mistaking devotion and love
- Surrendered to self-preservation
>From others who care for themselves
- But life as it touches perfection
- Appears just like anything else

- Isolation (3)
- Mother, I tried, please believe me
- I'm doing the best that I can
- I'm ashamed of the things
- I've been put through
- I'm ashamed of the person I am

- Isolation (3)
- But if you could just see the beauty
- These things I could never describe
- Pleasures and wayward distraction
- Is this my wonderful prize?
- Isolation (5)
