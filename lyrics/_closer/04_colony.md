title: Colony
---
- A cry for help, a hint of anaesthesia
- The sound from broken homes,
we used to meet always here
- As he lays asleep she takes him in her arms
- Some things I have to do
but I don't mean you harm

- I wore a careless glance
and kissed her last goodbye
- Hands in the bag she packed a tear
she tries to hide
- Cruel wind that howls down
to our lunacy
- And leaves him standing cold
here in this colony

- I can't see why
all these confrontations
- I can't see why
all these dislocations
- No, family life just makes me feel
uneasy
- Stood alone here in this colony
- In this colony (4)
- Yeah, God in his wisdom
took you by the hand,
- God in his wisdom made you understand (4)
- In this colony (4)
