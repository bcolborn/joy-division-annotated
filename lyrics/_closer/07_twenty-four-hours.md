title: Twenty-four Hours
---
- So this is permanence -
- Love shattered pride
- What once was innocence,
turned on its side
- A cloud hangs over me,
marks every move
- Deep in the memory,
what once was love
{:.verse}

- Oh how I've realized, I wanted time
- Put into perspective,
try so hard to find
- Just for one moment I thought
- I'd got my way
- Destiny unfolded -
watched it slip away
{:.verse}

- Excessive flash points,
beyond all reach
- Solitary demands for all
- I'd like to keep
- Let's take a ride out,
see what we can find
- Valueless collection of hopes
and past desires
{:.verse}

- I never realized the lengths
- I'd have to go
- All the darkest corners of a sense
- I didn't know
- Just for one moment -
hearing someone call
- Looked beyond the day in hand
- There's nothing there at all
{:.verse}

- Now that I've realized how it's
all gone wrong
- Got to find some therapy -
this treatment takes too long
- Deep in the heart of where
sympathy held sway
- Got to find my destiny before
it gets too late
{:.verse}
