title: Passover
---
- This is the crises I knew had to come
- Destroying the balance
- I'd kept
- Doubting and settling and turning around
- Wondering what will come next

- Is this the role that you wanted to live
- I was foolish to ask for so much
- Without the protection and infancy's guard
- It all falls apart at the first touch

- Watching the reel as it comes to a close
- Brutally taking its time
- People who change for no reason at all
- It's happening all of the time

- Can I go on with this train of defense
- Disturbing and purging my mind
- I count up my duties -
when all's said and done
- I know that I'll lose every time

- Moving along in our God given ways
- Safety is sat by the fire
- Sanctuary from these feverish smiles
- Left with a mark on the door

- Is this the gift that I wanted to give
- Forgive and forget's
what they teach
- I'll pass through the deserts and waste -
lands once more
- And watch as they drop by the beach

- This is a crises I knew had to come
- Destroying the balance I'd kept
- Turning around to the next set of lies
- Wondering what will come next
