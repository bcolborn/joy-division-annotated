title: Decades
---
- Here are the young men,
a weight on their shoulders
- Here are the young men,
well where have they been?
- We knocked on doors
of hell's darker chambers
- Pushed to the limits,
we dragged ourselves in
- Watched from the wings as
the scenes were replaying
- We saw ourselves now as
we never had seen
- Portrayal of the traumas and degeneration
- The sorrows we suffered
and never were freed
- Where have they been (4)

- Weary inside, now our hearts
lost forever
- Can't replace the fear
or the thrill of the chase
- These rituals showed up the door
for our wanderings
- Opened and shut, then slammed
in our face
- Where have they been (4)
