title: Novelty

- When the people listen to you don't you
know it means a lot 'cos you've got to
work so hard for everything you've got
- Can't rest on your laurels now
- Not when you've got none
- You'll find yourself in a gutter
- Right back where you came from
{:.verse}

- Someone told me being in the know
is the main thing
- We all need the security
that belonging brings
- Can't stand on your own in these times
against all the odds
- You all just fall behind like all
the other sods
{:.verse}

- You slap your back
and pretend you knew about
all the things that we were gonna do
- What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do
when it's over?
- You're all on your own now,
- Don't you think that's a shame
- But you're the only one responsible
to take the blame
- So what ya gonna do when the novelty
has gone
- Yeah, what ya gonna do when the novelty
has gone
- You slap your backs
and pretend you knew about
all the things we were gonna do
- What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do
- When its over?
