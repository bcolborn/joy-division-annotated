title: Novelty
---

- When the people listen to you don't you
- Know it means a lot 'cos you've got to
- Work so hard for everything you've got
- Can't rest on your laurels now
- Not when you've got none
- You'll find yourself in a gutter
- Right back where you came from
{:.verse}

- Someone told me being in the know
- Is the main thing
- We all need the security
- That belonging brings
- Can't stand on your own in these times
- Against all the odds
- You all just fall behind like all
- The other sods
{:.verse}

- You slap your back
- And pretend you knew about
- All the things that we were gonna do
- What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do
- When it's over?
- You're all on your own now,
- Don't you think that's a shame
- But you're the only one responsible
- To take the blame
- So what ya gonna do when the novelty
- Has gone
- Yeah, what ya gonna do when the novelty
- Has gone
- You slap your backs
- And pretend you knew about
- All the things we were gonna do
- What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do
- When its over?
