title: These Days
---

- Morning seems strange, almost out of place
- Searched hard for you and your special ways
- These days -- please stay
- Spent all my time,
learnt to kill is hard
- Took threats and abuse
till I'd lived apart
- Can you stay -- for these days?
- These days -- these days
- Use hard-worn deception to get away
- Broken heart romance
to make it pay
- These days -- these days
- We'll tread through it all
- This modern age
- Take care of it all now these debts
are paid
- Can you stay -- for these days?
