- 3 - 5 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 5 - Go!
- I was there in the backstage
- When first light came around
- I grew up like a changeling
- To wait the first time around
- I could see all the weakness --
- I could pick all the faults
- But I concede all the faith tests --
- Just a stick in your throat
- 3 - 1 - G (3)

- Hung around in your soundtrack --
- To mirror all that you've done
- To find the right side of reason
- To kill the three lies for one
- I could see all the cold facts --
- I could see through your eyes
- All this don't make no contact
- No matter how hard I try
- 3 - 1 - G (3)

- I could still hear the footsteps --
- I could see only walls
- I say 'hey' for you mad traps --
- Hearing no at all
- I could see contradiction --
- I could give up the fight
- Just to live in the past tense --
- To make believe you were right!
- 3 - 1 - G (3)
