title: Love Will Tear Us Apart
---

- When the routine bites hard
- And ambitions are low
- And the resentment rides high
- But emotions won't grow
- And we're changing our ways,
- Taking different roads
- Then love, love will tear us apart
- Again (4)

- Why is the bedroom so cold
- Turned away on your side?
- Is my timing that flawed,
- Our respect run so dry?
- Yet there's still this appeal
- That we've kept through
- Our lives
- Love, love will tear us apart again (4)

- Do you cry out in your sleep
- All my failings expose?
- Get a taste in my mouth
- As desperation takes hold
- Is it something so good
- Just can't function no more?
- When love, love will tear us apart
- Again (4)
