Radio -- live transmission -- radio

live transmission

Listen to the silence, let it ring on

Eyes dark, relentless, frightened of the sun

We would have a fine time living in the night

Be left a blind destruction,

Waiting for our sight

We would go on as though nothing was

wrong

Hide from these days to remain all alone

Staying in the same place,

just staring at the tide

Touching from a distance, further all the time



Dance, dance, dance, dance,

dance to the radio (4)

Well I could call out when the going

gets tough

The things we've learned are no longer

enough

No language, just sound is all

we need know

To synchronise love to the beat

of the show

And we could dance -- dance, dance,

dance, dance, to the radio (4)
