title: No Love Lost
---
- So long sitting here --
- Didn't here the warning
- Waiting for the tape to run
- We've been moving round in different
situations
- Knowing that the time would come
- Knowing that the time would come
- Just to see you torn apart --
witness to your empty heart
- I need it (3)

- Through the wire screen the eyes
of those standing outside
locked in at her as if into the cage
of some rare creature in a zoo.
- In the hand of one of the assistants she saw
the same instrument which they had that
morning inserted deep
into her body.
- She shuddered instinctively.
- No life at all in the House
of Dolls. No love lost (3)

- You've been seeing things in darkness --
- Running, learning
- Hoping that the truth will pass
- No life underground
- Wasting, never changing
- Wishing that this thing won't last
- To never see you show your age
- To watch the feeling fades
- I need it
