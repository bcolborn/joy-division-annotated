title: Failures
---

- Don't speak a false facade
- Failure of modern man
- To the centre of our face he dived
- Has a hold on a nose of red
- Grew up in a hall of steel
- Made the image of your fathers son
- Not to an inner feel
- He was thought of as the only one
{:.verse}

- He no longer denies --
- All the failures of the modern man
- He no longer decides --
- Sees the failures of the modern man
- Wise words and sympathy
- Tell the story of our history
- New strength gives a real touch
- Sense of reasons make it all too much
- With a strange fatality
- Fade the spirits of a lesser man
- Some other race could see
- In his way he was the only one
{:.verse}

- He no longer denied --
- All the failures of the modern man
- No, no his God decides --
- See the failures of the modern man
- Now that it's right to decide
- In his time he was the total man
- Taken from Caesar's side
- Kept in silence just to prove
us wrong
- No, no his God decides
- All the failures of the modern man
- No, no longer denies
- All the failures of the modern man
{:.verse}
