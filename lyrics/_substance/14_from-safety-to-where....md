title: From Safety to Where...?

No, I don't know just why, No,

I don't know just why

Which way to turn, I've got this ticket

to use

Through child-like ways, rebellion and crime

To reach this point

and retreat back again

The broken hearts, all the wheels

that are turned

The memory's scarred

and the vision blurred



No, I don't know which way,

Don't know which way to turn

The best possible use -- Just passing

through 'till we reach the next stage

Just to where-well, it's all been arranged

Just passing through

but the break must be made

Should we move on

or stay safely away?

Through child-like ways, rebellion and crime

To reach this point

and retreat back again

The broken hearts, all the wheels

that are turned

The memory's scarred

and the vision blurred

Just passing through

'till we reach the next stage

But just to where-well, it's all been arranged

Just passing through

but the break must be made

Should we move on

or stay safely away?
