title: From Safety to Where...?

- No, I don't know just why, No,
- I don't know just why
- Which way to turn, I've got this ticket
- To use
- Through child-like ways, rebellion and crime
- To reach this point
- And retreat back again
- The broken hearts, all the wheels
- That are turned
- The memory's scarred
- And the vision blurred

- No, I don't know which way,
- Don't know which way to turn
- The best possible use -- Just passing
- Through 'till we reach the next stage
- Just to where-well, it's all been arranged
- Just passing through
- But the break must be made
- Should we move on
- Or stay safely away?
- Through child-like ways, rebellion and crime
- To reach this point
- And retreat back again
- The broken hearts, all the wheels
- That are turned
- The memory's scarred
- And the vision blurred
- Just passing through
'till we reach the next stage
- But just to where-well, it's all been arranged
- Just passing through
- But the break must be made
- Should we move on
- Or stay safely away?
