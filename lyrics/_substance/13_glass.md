Hearts fail -- young hearts fail

Anytime -- that's allright

Over here -- all the time

Take it quick -- take it neat

Cross your hands -- twist your feet

Take it quick -- take it neat (2)

Hearts fail -- young hearts fail

Anytime -- whereabout?

On the run -- on the ground

Put your hand -- where it's safe

Lay your hand -- where it's safe

And do it again

Do it again and again and again (4)



Anytime -- that's allright

Told ya we should do it again

Over here -- all the time

Told ya we should do it again (3)

Anytime -- that's allright

Told ya we should do it again

Told ya we should do it again

I betcha we should do it again

Do it again (5)
