title: She's Lost Control
---

Confusion in her eyes that says it all --

She's lost control

And she's clinging to the nearest passerby

She's lost control

And she gave away the secrets of her past

And said "I've lost control again."

And heard the voice that told her

when and where to act

She said "I've lost control again".



And she turned to me and took me by the hand

And said "I've lost control again"

And how I'll never know just why

or understand

She said "I've lost control again"

And she screamed out, kicking on her side

and said "I've lost control again"

And seized up on the floor --

I thought she'd died

She said "I've lost control again"

She's lost control again --

she's lost control (2)



Well I had to phone her friend to state

her case and say she's lost control again

And she showed up all the errors and mistakes

And said "I've lost control again"

But she expressed herself in many different

ways until she'd lost control again

And walked upon the edge of no escape

and laughed "I've lost control again"

She's lost control again,

she's lost control (2)



I could live a little there

In the midst of the light

When the darkness closed in

I could have broke down and cried

I could live a little

In the white of light

When the change is gone

When the caring's gone

To lose control --

when the caring's gone
