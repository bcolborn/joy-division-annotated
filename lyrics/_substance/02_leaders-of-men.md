title: Leaders of Men
---

- Born from some mother's womb --
- Just like any other room
- Made a promise for a new life --
- Made a victim out of your life
- When your time's on the door --
- And you trip on the floor
- And you feel you can touch --
- All the noise is too much
- And the seeds that are sown --
- Are no longer your own
- Just a minor operation --
- To force the final ultimatum
- A thousand words are spoken loud
- Reach that gun to fool the crowds
- When you walk down the street and the
sound that's so sweet
- And you wish you could hide --
- Maybe go for a ride
- To some picture arcade --
- Where the future's not made
- A nightmare situation --
- Infiltrate imagination
- Smacks of past holy wars --
- Fight a war with broken laws
- The leaders of men --
- Born out of your frustration
- The leaders of men --
- Just a strange infatuation
- The leaders of men -- Made
a promise for a new life
- No saviour for our sakes
- To crush the atrocities of hate
- Self-induced manipulation
- To crush all thoughts of mass-salvation
