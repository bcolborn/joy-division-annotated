- This is the hour when the mysteries emerge

- Strangeness so hard to reflect

- A moment so moving goes straight

to your heart

- Condition that's never been met

- The attraction that's held like a wake

deep inside

- Something I'll never forget

- Pattern is set, the reaction will start

- Complete but rejected too soon

- Looking ahead in the grip of each tear

- Impulse that blinds every move

- Shadow that stood by the side of the road

- Always reminds me of you

- How can I find the right way

to control

- All the conflicts inside,

- All the problems beside

- As the questions are right,

and the answers don't fit

- Into my way of paying, into my way

of paying
