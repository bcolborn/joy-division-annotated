- Feel it closing in, feel it closing in

- A fear of whom I call,

hearing someone call

- I feel it closing in, I feel it closing in

- Day in, day out (6)



- I feel it closing in,

- As patterns seem to form

- I feel it cold and warm

- As shadows start to fall

- I feel it closing in, I feel it closing in

- Day in, day out (5)



- I'd have the world to just see

whatever happens to my decorum

- And then just fade away

- I see you fade away, don't ever fade away

- I need you here today

- Don't ever fade away (4)

- Fade away (7)
