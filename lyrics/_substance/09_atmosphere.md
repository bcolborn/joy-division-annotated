- Walk -- in silence
- Don't walk away -- in silence
- See the danger -- always danger
- Endless talking -- life rebuilding
- Don't walk away
{:.verse}

- Walk -- in silence
- Don't turn away -- in silence
- Your confusion -- my illusion
- Worn like a mask of self-hate
- Confronts and then dies
- Don't walk away
{:.verse}

- People like you -- find it easy
- Aching to see -- walking on air
- Hunting by rivers, through the streets, every corner abandoned to soon
- Set down with due care
- Don't walk away -- in silence --
- Don't walk away
{:.verse}
