Walk -- in silence

Don't walk away -- in silence

See the danger -- always danger

Endless talking -- life rebuilding

Don't walk away



Walk -- in silence

Don't turn away -- in silence

Your confusion -- my illusion

Worn like a mask

of self-hate

Confronts and then dies

Don't walk away



People like you -- find it easy

Aching to see -- walking on air

Hunting by rivers, through the streets,

every corner abandoned to soon

Set down with due care

don't walk away -- in silence --

Don't walk away
