# Heart and Soul

Instants that can still betray us

A journey that leads to the sun

Soulless and bent on destruction

Struggle between right and wrong

You take my place in the show-down

I'll observe with a pitiful eye

And humble ask for forgiveness

A request well beyond you and I

Heart and soul, one will burn (2)



An abyss that lasted creation

A circus complete with all fools

Foundations that lasted the ages

Then ripped apart at their roots

Beyond all this good the terror

The grip of a mercenary hand

When savagery returns

for good reason

There's no turning back the last stand

Heart and soul, one will burn (2)



Existence-well what does it matter

I exist on the best terms I can

The past is now part of my future

The present is well out of hand (2)

Heart and soul, one will burn (2)

One will burn, one will burn

Heart and Soul, one will burn
