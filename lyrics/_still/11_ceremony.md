- I've heard them all,
no mercy shown
- Heaven knows it's got to be this time
- What she'd heard,
these things she said
- This time she cried
and failed to wait, this time

- Oh I've heard them all, no mercy shown
- Heaven knows it's got to be this time
- Avenues all lined with trees
- Pictures me and then you start watching,
watching forever (2)
- Forever - watching love grow
- Forever - letting me know (2)
