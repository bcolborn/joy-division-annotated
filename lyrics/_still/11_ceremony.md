- I've heard them all,
- No mercy shown
- Heaven knows it's got to be this time
- What she'd heard,
- These things she said
- This time she cried
- And failed to wait, this time

- Oh I've heard them all, no mercy shown
- Heaven knows it's got to be this time
- Avenues all lined with trees
- Pictures me and then you start watching,
- Watching forever (2)
- Forever - watching love grow
- Forever - letting me know (2)
{:.verse}
