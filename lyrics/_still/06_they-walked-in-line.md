title: They Walked in Line
---



All dressed in uniform so fine

They drank and killed to pass the time

Wearing the shame

of all their crimes

With measured steps they walked in line

They walked in line (8)



They carried pictures

of their wives

And number tags

to prove their lies

They walked in line (8)

Full of a glory never seen

They made it through the whole machine

To never question anymore

Hypnotic trance

they never saw

They walked in line (8-16)

Walked in line (2)
