- See my true reflection

put out my own connections

- I can see it's getting

harder, so sad is this sensation

- Reverse the situation,

- I can't see it getting better



- I'll walk you through the heartbreak,

show you all the out-taken

- I can't see it getting higher,

systematically degraded

- Emotionally a scapegoat,

- I can't see it getting higher



- For person unrealistic,

try to make it all stick

- I can see it getting harder,

all am now am burnt out

- All I need's a break out,

- I can't see it getting higher



- Love - life don't you feel we're

higher, higher, higher

don't you feel higher, higher, etc.
