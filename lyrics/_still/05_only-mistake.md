title: The Only Mistake
---

- Made the fatal mistake like
- I did once before
- Tendency just to take till
- The purpose stood sour
- Strain - take the strain,
- These days - we learn
- Strain - feel the strain,
- As these days - we learn
- Yeah, the only mistake was
- That you ran away
- Yeah, the only mistake was
- That you ran away
- Avenues lined with trees planned your course
- For the day
- Yeah, the only mistake like I made
- Once before
- Yeah, the only mistake could have
- Made it before
{:.verse}

- Strain - take the strain,
- These days - we learn
- Strain - take the strain,
- These days - we learn
- And the only mistake led to rumours
- And found
- Led to pleasures and pain different
- Feelings and sounds
- Yeah the only mistake like
- I made once before
- Yeah the only mistake could have
- Made it before
