title: The Only Mistake
---



- Made the fatal mistake like

- I did once before

- Tendency just to take till

the purpose stood sour

- Strain - take the strain,

these days - we learn

- Strain - feel the strain,

as these days - we learn

- Yeah, the only mistake was

that you ran away

- Yeah, the only mistake was

that you ran away

- Avenues lined with trees planned your course

for the day

- Yeah, the only mistake like I made

once before

- Yeah, the only mistake could have

made it before



- Strain - take the strain,

these days - we learn

- Strain - take the strain,

these days - we learn

- And the only mistake led to rumours

and found

- Led to pleasures and pain different

feelings and sounds

- Yeah the only mistake like

- I made once before

- Yeah the only mistake could have

made it before
