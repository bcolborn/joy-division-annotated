title: The Kill
---

- Moved in a hired car
and I find no way to run
- Adds every moment longer
had no time for fun
- Just something that I knew I had to do
- But through it all
- I kept my eyes on you
{:.verse}

- I had an impulse to clear it all away
- I used the tactics - make everybody pay
- Just something that I knew I had to do
- But through it all
- I kept my eyes on you
{:.verse}

- Oh I keep it all traded in
- I've paid the graces there
- No kidding, misuse -
no sign of blood
{:.verse}

- Just something that I knew I had to do
- But through it all
- I kept my eyes on you
- Yeah through it all
- I kept my eyes on you
- But through it all
- I kept my eyes on you
{:.verse}
