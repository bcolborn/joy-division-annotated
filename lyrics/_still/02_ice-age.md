- Seen the real atrocities, buried in the sand
- Stockpiled safety for a few -
- we stand holding hands I -
- living in the iceage (2)
{:.verse}

- Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
- Into the cold, no smile on your lips
- Living in the iceage (3)
{:.verse}

- Searching for another way, see them hide behind the door
- Live in holes and disused shafts hoped a little more
- I - living in the iceage (2)
{:.verse}

- Nothing will hold, nothing will fit
- Into the cold, no smile on your lips
- Living in the iceage (3 4)
