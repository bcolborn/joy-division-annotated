title: Ice Age

- Seen the real atrocities, buried in the sand

- Stockpiled safety for a few -

we stand holding hands I -

living in the iceage (2)



- Nothing will hold, nothing will fit

- Into the cold, no smile on your lips

- Living in the iceage (3)



- Searching for another way,

see them hide behind the door

- Live in holes and disused shafts

hoped a little more

- I - living in the iceage (2)



- Nothing will hold, nothing will fit

- Into the cold, no smile on your lips

- Living in the iceage (3 4)
