- Someone take these dreams away

- That point me to another day

- A duel of personalities

- That stretch all true reality

- And keep calling me

- They keep calling me

- Keep on calling me

- They keep calling me



- When figures from the past stand tall

- And mocking voices ring the hall

- Imperialistic house of prayer

- Conquistadores who took their share

- And keep calling me

- They keep calling me

- Keep on calling me

- They keep calling me



- Calling me, calling me (2)

- They keep calling me

- Keep on calling me

- The keep calling me (2)
