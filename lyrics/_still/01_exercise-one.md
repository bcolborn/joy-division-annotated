title: Exercise One
---

- When you're looking at life in a strange new room
- Maybe drowning soon,
- Is this the start of it all?
- Turn on your TV, Turn down you audiophone
- Turn away from it all, it's all getting too much
- When you're looking at life, deciphering scars
- Tense group all who sit still in their cars
- The lights look bright when you reach outside
- Time for one last ride before the end of it all
