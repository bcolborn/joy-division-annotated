title: Something Must Break
---

- To waste and choose or raise the dead
- With pain behind go straight ahead
- Room full of people grouping
- As one
- I can't break out now
- The time just won't come
{:.verse}

- To waste and choose which way to go
- Decide for me please let me know
- Looked in the mirror
- Saw I was wrong
- If I could get back to - where I belong
{:.verse}

- To waste and choose which way to go
- I paused for one
- Whom signs forbode
- If we were immortal we would not bear
- Washed up on the beat here
- Struggle for air
- I see you face still in my window
- Tormented clouds won't set me free
- Something must break now -
- This life isn't mine
- Something must break now -
- Wait for the time
{:.verse}
