title: Wilderness
---

- I traveled far and wide through many
different times
- What did you see there?
- I saw all knowledge destroyed
{:.verse}

- I traveled far and wide to prisons
of the cross
- What did you see there?
- The power and glory of sin
- What did you see there?
- The blood of Christ on their skins
- I traveled far and wide through many
different times
{:.verse}

- I traveled far and wide where
unknown martyrs died
- I saw the one-sided trials
- What did you see there?
- I saw the tears as they cried
- They had tears in their eyes!
- Tears in their eyes! (3)
