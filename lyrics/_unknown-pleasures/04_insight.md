- Guess the dream always end
- They don't rise up just descend
- But I don't care anymore
- I've lost the will to want more
- I'm not afraid, not at all
- I watch them all as they fall
- But I remember, when we were young
{:.verse}

- Those with habits of waste
- The sense of style and the taste
- Of making sure you were right
- Hey, don't you know you were right
- I'm not afraid anymore
- I keep my eyes on the door
- But I remember...

- Tears and sadness for you
- Awe of evil for you
- Reflects a moment in time
- A special moment in time
- Yeah, we wasted our time
- We didn't really have time
- But we remember - when we were young
{:.verse}

- And all God's angels beware
- And all you judges beware
- Sons of chance take good care
- For all the people out there
- I'm not afraid anymore (4)
