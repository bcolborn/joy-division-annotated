title: I Remember Nothing
---

- We were strangers, we were strangers,
- Away too long,
- Away too long
- We were violent strangers,
- Away too long,
- Get weak all the time,
- We just passed the time
- Me in my own world, yeah you there beside
- The gaps only moment,
- We stared from each side
- We were strangers, away too long
{:.verse}

- Violent, more violent his hand cracks the chair
- Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair
- Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon
- Me in my own world
- Away too long
- We were strangers (2)
- Away too long (2)
{:.verse}
