title: I Remember Nothing
---

- We were strangers, we were strangers,
- Away too long,
away too long
- We were violent strangers,
away too long,
- Get weak all the time,
we just passed the time
- Me in my own world, yeah you there beside
- The gaps only moment,
we stared from each side
- We were strangers, away too long
{:.verse}

- Violent, more violent his hand
cracks the chair
- Moves on reaction, then slumps,
in despair
- Trapped in a cage and surrendered
too soon
- Me in my own world
- Away too long
- We were strangers (2)
- Away too long (2)
