title: Candidate

- Forced by the pressure, the territory's

marked

- No longer the pleasure, Oh I've since

lost the heart

- Corrupted from memory, no longer the power

- It's creeping up slowly, that last

fatal hour



- Oh I don't know what made me,

or what gave me the night

- To mess with your values

- And change wrong to right



- Please keep your distance

the trail leads to here,

- There's blood on your fingers,

brought on by fear

- I campaigned for nothing,

- I worked hard for this

- I tried to get to you

you treat me like this



- It's just second nature,

it's what we've been shown

- We're living by your rules,

that's all that we know

- I tried to get to you (3)

- Oh how I tried to get to you
