title: Interzone

- I walked through city limits
- Someone took me by the hand in the blue
- Attracted by some force within it
- If I could close my eyes,
- I could get used to it
- Around the corner where a puppet lay
- Saw the place where she had a room to stay
- A wire fence
- Where children play
- Saw them dance where the body lay
- And I was looking for a friend of mine
{:.verse}

- The car screeched in the sand and dust
- Feel encouraged -
- Just a car on it's side
- Metallic blue turned red with rust
- Pulled it close by the buildin's side
- In a room for forgotten youth
- I could think or let my senses slide
- Turned on to a night with you
- Find the place where my friends, won't go
- And I was looking for a friend of mine
- And I had no time to lose
- Yeah looking for some friends of mine
- Down the dark street,
- The houses looked the same
- Stopped and turned around,
- Held me to a game
- I walked round and round,
- You nailed me to a tree
- Trying to find a way,
- Trying to find a way, to get out
{:.verse}

- For twelve windows stand in a row
- Behind a wall
- Where a room to go
- The light shined like a neon show
- See the deep mellow warmth
- Of the glow
- No place to stop,
- No place to go
- No time to lose,
- Have to keep on going
- I guess they died some time ago
- I guess they died some time ago
- And I was looking for a friend of mine
- And I have no time to lose
- Yeah, I was looking for a friend of mine
