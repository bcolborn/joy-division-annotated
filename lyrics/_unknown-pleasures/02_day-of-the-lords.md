[Verse 1]

- This is the room, the start of it all
{:.verse}

- No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall
{:.verse}

- I've seen the nights, filled with bloodsport and pain
{:.verse}

- And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained
{:.verse}

[Refrain]

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?


[Verse 2]

- These are your friends from childhood, through youth
{:.verse}

- Who goaded you on, demanded more proof
{:.verse}

- Withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in
{:.verse}

- So distorted and thin, distorted and thin
{:.verse}

[Refrain]

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?
