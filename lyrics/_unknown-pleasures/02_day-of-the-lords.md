title: Day of the lords

[Verse 1]

- This is the room, the start of it all

- No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall

- I've seen the nights, filled with bloodsport and pain

- And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained


[Refrain]

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?


[Verse 2]

- These are your friends from childhood, through youth

- Who goaded you on, demanded more proof

- Withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in

- So distorted and thin, distorted and thin


[Refrain]

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?

- Where will it end?
