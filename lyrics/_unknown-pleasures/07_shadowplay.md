title: Shadowplay
---

- To the centre of the city where all roads meet 
- Looking for you
- To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank
- Searching for you
- Moving through the silence without motion
- Waiting for you
- In a room with no window in the corner,
- I found truth
{:.verse}

- In the shadowplay
- Acting out your own death
- Knowing more
- As the assassins all grouped in four lines,
- Dancing on the floor,
- And with cold steel odour on their bodies,
- Made a move to connect
- I could only stare in disbelief
- As the crowds all left
{:.verse}

- I did everything, everything I wanted to
- I let them use you -
- For their own ends
- To the centre of the city in night
- Waiting for you (2)
{:.verse}
