title: She's Lost Control
---

- Confusion in her eyes that says it all -
- She's lost control
- And she's clinging to the nearest passer-by
- She's lost control
- And she gave away the secrets of her past
- And said "I've lost control again."
{:.verse}

- And she turned to me
- And took me by the hand
- And said "I've lost control again"
- And how I'll never know just why or understand
- She said "I've lost control again"
- And she screamed out, kicking on her side
- And seized up on the floor -
- I thought she'd died
- She said "I've lost control again"
- She's lost control again -
- She's lost control
{:.verse}

- Well I had to phone her friend
- To state her case and say
- She's lost control again
- And she showed up all the errors and mistakes
- And said "I've lost control again"
- But she expressed herself in many different ways
- Until she'd control again
- And walked upon the edge of no escape
- And laughed "I've lost control again"
- She's lost control again,
- She's lost control (2)
