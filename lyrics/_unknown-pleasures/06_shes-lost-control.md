title: She's Lost Control
---
- Confusion in her eyes that says it all -
- She's lost control
- And she's clinging to the nearest passer-by
- She's lost control
- And she gave away the secrets of her past
- And said "I've lost control again."

- And she turned to me
and took me by the hand
and said "I've lost control again"
and how I'll never know just why
or understand
- She said "I've lost control again"
- And she screamed out, kicking on her side
- And seized up on the floor -
- I thought she'd died
- She said "I've lost control again"
- She's lost control again -
she's lost control

- Well I had to phone her friend
to state her case and say
she's lost control again
- And she showed up all the errors
and mistakes
and said "I've lost control again"
- But she expressed herself in many
different ways
until she'd control again
- And walked upon the edge of no escape
and laughed "I've lost control again"
- She's lost control again,
she's lost control (2)
