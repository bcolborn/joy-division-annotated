title: Shadowplay
---

To the centre of the city where all roads

meet looking for you

To the depths of the ocean

where all hopes sank searching for you

Moving through the silence without motion

waiting for you

In a room with no window in the corner,

I found truth



In the shadowplay, acting out your

own death, knowing more

As the assassins all grouped

in four lines,

Dancing on the floor,

And with cold steel, odour on their bodies,

made a move to connect

I could only stare in disbelief

as the crowds all left



I did everything, everything I wanted to

I let them use you -

for their own ends

To the centre of the city in night

waiting for you (2)
